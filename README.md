# Chestnut

Chestnut is a Minecraft plugin that watches specific blocks and
sends customizable Discord webhook messages when something happens to them.
<br>Use it to keep an eye on mailboxes, redstone torches, and more, with alerts that
can be fully tailored to match your style and needs.

> **Why "Chestnut"?**  
> Well, it started as ‚ÄúChest-Nut‚Äù ‚Äî because, you know, it keeps an eye on chests.

## Trigger Reference

All triggers support basic tags like `<name>`, `<trigger>`, `<event>`, `<world>`, `<x>`, `<y>`, `<z>` and `<time>`.
<br>Some triggers add extra tags listed below. <br><br>**Note**: `<name>` defaults to the tracker's given title; otherwise it uses the tracker's id name.

## Example: Monitoring a Mailbox

Imagine a chest at spawn where players drop off items. You want a Discord alert
whenever it is opened.

1. Stand by the chest and type:

   ```
   /settracker mailbox storage  
   ```

    * **mailbox** = the name you give this tracker
    * **storage** = what to watch. You can choose one of:

        * `storage` ‚Äì storage blocks like chests, barrels, shulker boxes
        * `redstone_torch` ‚Äì a redstone torch turning on/off
        * `lectern` ‚Äì a lectern‚Äôs book actions and reading 
    
    After running the command, you‚Äôll have **60 seconds** to right-click the chest to bind it to the tracker.


2. Customize the messages sent via webhook:

   ```
   /edittracker mailbox msg open "<user> checked the <name>!"  
   /edittracker mailbox msg close "<user> closed the <name>. Items: <items>"  
   ```

3. Add some color and icons:

   ```
   /edittracker mailbox color open #00FF00  
   /edittracker mailbox color close #FF0000  
   /edittracker mailbox thumbnail open https://example.com/open.png  
   /edittracker mailbox thumbnail close https://example.com/close.png  
   ```

4. Try it out with a test event:

   ```
   /edittracker mailbox test open  
   ```

Now every time the chest is used, an embed will be posted to your webhook with
the configured title, description, color, and thumbnail.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this plugin on a server that already has a Discord bot?**
<br>Yes, absolutely. Chestnut works independently, it sends webhook messages directly to Discord. It doesn‚Äôt need to connect to or control an existing bot, so it won‚Äôt interfere with whatever your bot is doing.

**Q: Does Chestnut only work with Discord?**
<br>Yes. Right now Chestnut sends webhook messages in a format designed for Discord. This could possibly be extended to other services in the future.

**Q: Will it slow down my server if I track a lot of blocks?**
<br>Possibly. I haven‚Äôt stress-tested the limits yet, but like most plugins, tracking very large numbers of blocks could impact performance. It‚Äôs best to start small and scale up while monitoring your server‚Äôs TPS.

**Q: Can I send webhooks to multiple channels?**
<br>Not at this time. Chestnut supports a single webhook URL per server configuration. I would like to add support for multiple channels in the future.

**Q: Why don‚Äôt my alerts look like the example screenshots?**
<br>Out of the box, Chestnut uses simple default messages without custom colors or thumbnails. The examples in the screenshots use customized settings configured with `/edittracker` commands.

**Q: I found a bunch of bugs! üêõ**
<br>lol yeah‚Ä¶ this is my first plugin :) i‚Äôm still figuring stuff out...
